# optical_spectrum_reconstruction

Deep learning methods have been used as a powerful alternative to algebraic resolution techniques based on inverse problems approaches. Deep learning methods do not require matrix inversion operations, they rather rely on gradient descent methods combined with the backpropagation of errors algorithm. Thus, after training some neural networks (MLP, AE, GRU, LSTM) with a dataset of measured photocurrent values, faster and high-resolution spectral reconstruction can be done.

The dataset is too big to be stored on GitHub. It can be requested from the author.
